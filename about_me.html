        <p>My name is Christopher Ospina. I am 23 years old and I am from Lynbrook, NY in Long Island. I have two
            sisters
            and one brother as well as a bichon yorkie. For the past three years I have worked at National Healthcare
            Associates Inc as a Junior Systems Administrator. I am of Colombian and Puerto Rican descent and I belong to
            the Roman Catholic Faith. At Pace University I study Computer Science and I am pursuing a master's degree. I
            am
            involved in SetterStage, Film Club, Book Club, OLAS, Nature Club and of course the Seidenberg School.
            Outside of
            Pace I am a voice actor, filmmaker, writer and cosplayer (which I'm trying to quit). I also enjoy hiking,
            bike riding,
            playing football and basketball, playing video games and watching Marvel and Harry Potter movies. During my
            breaks I love to travel
            across NYC which includes their museums or Broadway shows.
